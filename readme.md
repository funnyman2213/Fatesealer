### Hello!

Thank you for your interest in Fatesealer. My Discord bot that implements my Scryfall API interface Fateseal. 

## Basic usage

At the moment Fatesealer's main function is to serve cards. you can query any card inline with your message by wrapping the name in brackets.

An example would be:
 + Have you seen \[Sol ring\]? that card is pretty crazy!

The bot will return a simple embed with the Card queried and a link to the Scryfall page for more information.
